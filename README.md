# Food-Recipe-Recommendation-System

<p align = "justify">The challenge of preparing enticing and nourishing food has plagued humanity for ages. People learned about good dishes either by word of mouth or trial and error and neither method placed focus on the dishes nutritional value.  With the advent of techniques in machine learning, it is now possible to leverage other peopleâ€™s food preferences to not only suggest dishes one might like but also personalize them in a way to help satisfy the nutritional requirements people need on a daily basis. The existing  food recipe recommendation system uses techniques such as collaborative filtering and content based algorithms. But the major drawback of this existing system is that it recommends only the recipes that already exist. Our proposed system tackles this problem by suggesting nutritional recipes that are tailored made for the user of the system.</p>
